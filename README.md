<h6>Note: This project is complete but has not been launched due to being in the process of retrieving the Spotify API extension which would allow all users to interact with this website (currently only devs are allowed!).</h6>
<h3>A Spotify-inspired website that shows what your current moods are based on your recent listening.</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>This project allowed me to work with Spotify's Web API to generate colors based off of a user's recently played tracks to create an audio aura. I gained experience with user authentication practices and data processing.</p>

<p>Please note that this project was heavily inspired by Spotify and the 2021 Wrapped Audio Aura feature. I take no credit for the concept.</p>

<h4>Impact</h4>
  • Show users how their recent listening reflects their moods in an engaging way<br>

<h4>Features</h4>
  • Populates data using <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/">Spotify's Web API</a><br>
  • Allows users to view an animated gradient of colors based on their recent moods as reflected through their recently played songs<br>
  • Includes a "Share Aura" feature that lets users share a snapshot of their aura<br>
  • Show users their current top 20 tracks (most listened to)<br>
